[Aboard](http://aboard.io) is an inspiration board for artists and designers which combines the most beautiful RSS feeds from the Web. You can create your own list, Aboard will remember it the next time you come.

The project has been created in two days as a personal challenge. It runs on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and a simple [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgkAchwwtS8IH9GPBD-LPLY41_okXHGHw7UTFGa-a18).

Aboard is shared under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

**Google closed its Feed API**, so Aboard now uses [xmlToJSON](https://github.com/metatribal/xmlToJSON) script by William Summers. Some popular feeds have broken in the process, and Dribbble seems to have closed its Recent and Debut feeds. So Aboard is kind of sinking, but I keep it live for the record.
