[Aboard](http://aboard.io) is an inspiration board for artists and designers which combines the most beautiful RSS feeds from the Web. You can create your own list, Aboard will remember it the next time you come.

Feel free to contact me at [captain@aboard.io](mailto:captain@aboard.io).

## Which RSS feeds are compatible?

To make your RSS feed compatible with Aboard, please follow these rules:
- put your images in `<img>` tags inside the `<description>` tag of your XML tree;
- use images at least 400 x 300px wide;
- there is no item count limitation, but 10 or more is better for the users.

Then send me an email with your feed URL so I can add it to Aboard.

## About Aboard

The project was first created in two days as a personal challenge. It initially run on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and a simple [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QgkAchwwtS8IH9GPBD-LPLY41_okXHGHw7UTFGa-a18) (using the [Google Spreadsheet to JSON API](https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample) and the [Google Feed API](https://developers.google.com/feed/)).

On november 2015, google closed its Feed API and Aboard couldn't fetch RSS anymore. I took the opportunity to redesign Aboard with some improvements I had noted in background until then, and give a try at [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/).
